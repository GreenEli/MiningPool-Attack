# MiningPool-Attack(project instruction)
This is the experimental code and data used in the multi-mining pool attack paper. This experiment is written based on the attack model of multiple mining pools. In terms of code, it is divided into experimental design and visual display. In terms of datasets, it is divided into experimental record datasets and static statistical datasets.

## Experimental design
This article is designed to revolve around the blockchain POW mechanism, simplifying the entire calculation power proof process to the process of finding a qualified hash value. In the experiment, 100 user processes were set up to compete for computing power, and each process was allocated equal computing power resources by default. Each process puts a different random number to obtain a hash value that meets the conditions. Only needed hash values that are continuously met in the shortest time can be a winner. There are two types of nodes in the article: honest nodes and malicious nodes. There are three types of mining pools: centralized attacking mining pools, decentralized attacking mining pools, and comprehensive attacking mining pools. Each mining pool is a collection of a certain number of users. In the three mining pool attack models, nodes compete for computing power in order to obtain the hash value that meets the conditions.

## Visual display
At the same time, in order to make the experimental dataset display to users better, this article also sets up a visual view design based on tomcat. The front-end search box is divided into two selection boxes and a text box. The first selection box is the data type: experimental data and static statistical data. The second selection box is the attack type: non-mining pool attack type, centralized mining pool attack type, decentralized mining pool attack type, and comprehensive mining pool attack type. The third is the dataset page number, which records the dataset of the attack data type.

### The specific pic process is as follows:
First enter the data type, attack type, and corresponding page. Then we can get the dataset we want.

## Experiment record dataset
This experiment is divided into four types: non-mining pool attack type, centralized mining pool attack type, decentralized mining pool attack type, and comprehensive mining pool attack type. Experiment records are performed under each type of mining pool attack. Finally, some necessary fields are reserved in the experiment record. For example: Node: USER_100 Type: Honest_Node Nonce: f6fcc6242d7fb3626375807a2b886b Hash: 3964cf6c9ae3d53729fc90bc2d1dc923ec7bc766968268e554e71a12844915cd Difficulty: 0079c2b939460ac70a6edab186dfd3c09f9be5218d394c1603e8ff870d8a55fb Confirm_Number: 0 Timestamp: 1632484166283 Result: failed. Finally, based on the experimental record data statistics, static statistical data can be further verified.

## Static statistical dataset
The static statistical dataset is a simulated dataset based on the blockchain computing power attack. For example, the static statistical dataset of the blockchain under the four attack models is as follows. Non-mining pool attacks: ( 0.15, 1, 0.3096983497692942 ); centralized mining pool attacks: ( { 0.2,0.03,0.02,0.1 }, 6, 0.2821712119090905 ); decentralized mining pool attacks: ( < 0.22,0.05,0.03,0.04 >, 1, 0.5796541821224418 ); comprehensive mining pool attacks: ( < { 0.15,0.02,0.06 },0.01,0.02 >, 3, 0.15477699619329324 ).

## Simple use:
### Prerequisite preparation. 
Editor: eclipse, class library: JavaSE-16, front-end service: Tomcat v8.5.
### The specific process is as follows:
First download the corresponding project from GitHub to the local space (https://github.com/GreenEli/MiningPool-Attack), and then import the corresponding class package on your GitHub (the default is in JavaSE-16). This article sets up 105 experimental classes, such as MiningPool_Cen_1.java, MiningPool_Cen_Decen_1.java, MiningPool_DeCen_1.java, NonminingPools_10_Percent.java, etc. In addition, because the experimental records generated by each experimental class in the code are inconsistent with the data query path of the front-end. After generating the dataset with the experimental class, the generated dataset should be copied to the front-end query path. For example, a data collection path in the front-end code of this experiment is F:\\DataSet\\ExperimentalData\\NonPool\\1.txt, you should copy the generated data in the experimental class to this path. Then you can start the experiment.

## Paper support
This paper conducts experiments on the basis of the four attack models in the paper. Obtained more than 1 billion experimental data units, and this article obtained more than 20 million static statistical data unit (Due to the limitation of GitHub data upload capacity, only some experimental and statistical data were uploaded in the project). Through the statistics of experimental data units, the experimental statistical data and static statistical data are compared and analyzed. There are some examples from four attack models:
### Non-mining pool attacks: 
Experimental object: In the non-mining pool attack model, nodes with 30% of malicious computing power conduct a malicious attack on the blockchain, and the number of confirmed blocks is 8. In the static statistical data, the corresponding data unit is ( 0.3, 8, 0.07392439570088279). In the experimental record (the experimental record is stored in GitHub as \src\main\java\DataSet\Experimental_Record\NonPool\30_8_1.rar and \src\main\java\DataSet\Experimental_Record\NonPool\30_8_2.rar), we conducted 100 computing power competitions, and finally the honest node succeeded 100 times. The malicious node succeeded 8 times.
### decentralized mining pool attacks:
Experimental object: In the mining pool decentralized attack model, the mining pools with a computing power composition of <20%, 10%, 5%, 5%> are scattered to carry out malicious attacks on the blockchain, and the number of confirmed blocks is 5. In the static statistical data, the corresponding data unit is (<0.2,0.1,0.05,0.05 >, 5, 0.028360036148750715); in the experimental record (the experimental record is stored in GitHub as \src\main\java\DataSet\Experimental_Record\Pool_DeCen\20_10_5_5_5.rar), we conducted 100 computing power competitions, and finally ,the Honest nodes Successful is:106. and mining Pool1 is:2 mining Pool2 is:0 mining Pool3 is:0 mining Pool4 is:1.
### centralized mining pool attacks:
Experimental object: In the centralized attack model of mining pools, mining pools with a computing power composition of {5%, 5%, 5%, 10%} join forces to conduct malicious attacks on the blockchain, and the number of confirmed blocks is 8. In the static statistical data, the corresponding data unit is ({0.05,0.05,0.05,0.1 }, 8, 0.020468165019681947); in the experimental record (the experimental record is stored in GitHub as \src\main\java\DataSet\Experimental_Record\Pool_Cen\5_5_5_10_8_1.rar and\src\main\java\DataSet\Experimental_Record\Pool_Cen\5_5_5_10_8_2.rar), we conducted 100 computing power competitions, and finally, the Honest nodes Succeful is:111. and malicious Nodes is:2.
### comprehensive mining pool attacks: 
Experimental object: In the comprehensive attack model of the mining pool, the mining pools with the computing power composition of <{0.03,0.07},0.05,0.1,{0.05,0.15}> conduct a comprehensive malicious attack on the blockchain, and the number of confirmed blocks is 4 . In the static statistical data, the corresponding data unit is (<{0.03,0.07},0.05,0.1,{0.05,0.15}>, 4, 0.059734237227362846,); in the experimental record (the experimental record is stored in GitHub as \src\main\java\DataSet\Experimental_Record\Pool_Cen_Den\3_7_5_10_5_15_4.rar), we conducted 100 computing power competitions, and finally, the Honest nodes Successful is:103. and mining Pool1 and Pool2 is:2 mining Pool3 is:1 mining Pool4 is:0 mining Pool6 and Pool7 is:2.

Therefore, the consistency of the model data is verified, and the final experimental results reflect the consistency and effectiveness of the mining pool attack model proposed in the paper.
